# **Adaptable Apps with Flutter**
##### by

# _‚ÄúWhat separates design from art is that design is meant to be‚Ä¶ functional.‚Äù_
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;‚Äì Cameron Moll

<!-- _class: lead -->
# <!-- fit --> What _is_ Functional Design?

---

# Responsive Design

A design approach that makes content render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from a minimum to a maximum display size. 

---

# Adaptive Design

A design approach that fundamentally changes the way that content is accessed in order to best cater towards the user's expectations of how content on their device should be accessed.

---

# From the Flutter Docs

Adapting an app to run on different device types, such as mobile and desktop, requires dealing with mouse and keyboard input, as well as touch input. It also means there are different expectations about the app‚Äôs visual density, how component selection works (cascading menus vs bottom sheets, for example), using platform-specific features (such as top-level windows), and more.

---

# What is Flutter?

Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, desktop, and embedded devices from a single codebase.

- Not Responsive
- Not Adaptive
- Provides the tools to make Responsive and Adaptive Apps.
- Powered by Dart

# Introducing the MediaQuery

```dart
MediaQuery.of(context);
```
| Methods | What they return |
|-------- | -------------|
| size    | screen size dimensions |
| devicePixelRatio | number of device pixels per logical pixel |
| orientation | Portrait or Landscape |
| textScaleFactor | number of font pixels for each logical pixel |
| viewInsets | parts of the display that are obscured by system ui like the keyboard  |

---

crossAxisCount: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 900 ? 5 : 3,
```

                (MediaQuery.of(context).size.aspectRatio * 4) * 20 :
                (MediaQuery.of(context).size.aspectRatio * 0.8) * 60,
    ...

---

## Aspect Ratio Tips

- Phones are slimmer than tablets (creating a more extreme ratio)
- Aspect Ratio changes with Orientation
- Multiply by a "Weight" to help direct how much influence the aspect ratio actually has. (0.5 to 2 is pretty common)

---

```dart
Text(this.text, 
    style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 16
        ...
        ),
)
```

```dart
var mediaData = MediaQuery.of(context);

Text(this.text, 
    style: TextStyle(
            fontSize: mediaData.textScaleFactor *
            (mediaData.size.aspectRatio.clamp(0.8, 1.2)) *
            16,
            ...
)

# We've made our app more responsive, but how do we make it _Adaptive_?

---

- ## Tablets, Laptops and Desktops have tighter (closer to 1) aspect ratios than phones
    - ### More space to work with
- ## Watches also have a tigher aspect ratio than phones
    - ### LESS space to work with.

---

- ## Think about how people use the device you're building for.
    - ### Most people would prefer to perform heavy-workloads on a desktop or laptop computer.
    - ### Tablets have become a staple for multi-taskers, artists, and note-takers.
    - ### I hate typing on a phone. Don't make me do it.

# Our grid will grow, but we need to make changes to the pet selection, too.

---

- Completely change the way the component is rendered depending on constraints
- use a LayoutBuilder and `constraints.maxHeight > 400`
  - check if the component is being rendered in a box greater than 400 pixels
  - **Phone**: that box is going to be smaller than 400px given the previous layoutbuilder change.
  - **Larger Devices**: will be greater than 400px given the previous change.
- [The code for this is actually kind of big, so here's a link (but we'll show a few pieces in a second)](https://gist.github.com/bradcypert/0911c744d8d55280eaf6a69c67a1bcb3)
