# <!-- fit --> What _is_ Functional Design?

---

# Responsive Design

A design approach that makes content render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes from a minimum to a maximum display size. 

---

# Adaptive Design

A design approach that fundamentally changes the way that content is accessed in order to best cater towards the user's expectations of how content on their device should be accessed.

---

# From the Flutter Docs

Adapting an app to run on different device types, such as mobile and desktop, requires dealing with mouse and keyboard input, as well as touch input. It also means there are different expectations about the app‚Äôs visual density, how component selection works (cascading menus vs bottom sheets, for example), using platform-specific features (such as top-level windows), and more.
